* Then, the user enters the ID of an item they want to buy and the quantity of that item they want to buy.

* If the user wants more of the item than the marketplace has(as in the case below), the transaction doesn't go through and the application ends.

* If the marketplace has more of the item than the user wants (as in the case below), the transaction completes and displays both the quantity left of the item in the marketplace and how much the user spent in total.
